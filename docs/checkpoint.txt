Eximo is a member of the Checkers family and it was designed in Februrary 2013. Unlike checkers, all the pieces are the same, there are never “special” pieces on the board. Each player starts with 16 pieces on a 8x8 square grid (see image below) and the goal of the game is simple: to capture all of the opponent’s pieces or stalemate the opponent so he has no more moves left.

As far as turns go, each player can only do one of two things on his turn: move or capture, they cannot do both. A checker can only move in one of 3 directions: north, northeast or northwest. In an ordinary move, a checker moves to an adjacent empty square. Otherwise, the player can choose to do a special move by jumping over a friendly piece to the next square in that same direction (the square must be empty). In case the player chooses to jump over a friendly piece, he must continue doing so as long as it is possible. On the other hand, a checker can capture in one of 5 directions: forward, diagonally forward (northeast and northwest), right or left. Similarly to the special move, a capture happens by jumping over an opponent’s piece to the next square on that same direction and the capture must continue as long as it is possible to do so. Capturing is mandatory whenever possible and a captured piece is removed from the board.

When a checker reaches the other end of the board, it is immediately removed from the board and the player gets to place 2 new pieces in the drop zone. The drop zone is the player’s first 2 rows, except the 2 on each end of the rows (only the 6 middle ones on each of the rows). If there isn’t enough space to put 2 new pieces, the player only drops pieces equal to the number of spots available in the drop zone.
